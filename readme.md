> A product to help humanity, and India as a country, especially during the novel COVID-19 stricken times, by consolidating the health care system and all different medical faculties onto one platform.

The app essentially allows hospitals to collaborate and share resources using a simple User Interface. When a hospital is in need of essential equipment urgently, and another hospital is willing to help out, they can contact each other and set up a delivery right through the app.

We provide hospitals with a platform to display all of their resources (like their medical supplies and equipment) and their staff, to keep them in check. It also gives you information about all other hospitals and their capacities, in a certain radius. Using this information, hospitals can place requests - and their level of urgency - for any commodities or capacity. Thus working together, and pitching in their resources, all our medical faculties will be able to manage the huge influx of patients and lack of equipment without too much worry. **These resources once shared, the transfer of supplies is validated with the use of blockchain technology.**

The dashboard system allows hospital's to manage their own resources, equipment, and staff in an efficient way. It can be accessed through any device (laptops, mobiles, tablets - whateverâ€™s most convenient), anywhere in the world. Our API is updated in real-time which allows for an efficient workflow and better overall management experience.

## What's next for Sahay

So we aim to provide a service to assist the medical industry in any way, and not binding with financial constraints. We would start off with a low scale release and testing phase, with around 100 - 200 users. Over the next month or two, start with funding to get it into a stable state and later release it into Delhi with a marketing campaign. If things go well, over the next 1-2 months we expand on our hospital database and provide our SaaS to even more hospitals. Later we plan for a nation-wide launch, get some sort of approval and help from the government to allow our team to expand. Sahay is not only limited to India and can also spread internationally, as it is essentially an application and wouldn't require too much effort to push ahead.

As we grow, we also have plans to release a public API as we'll have a large database of equipment that hospitals have. This data could be used by other developers to build apps that improve the interaction between users and hospitals. 

For example, in the current scenario in India, where everyone is looking for beds, remedesivir, and other resources, people are having to manually call up hospitals and suppliers to verify whether these resources are available. As our API updates in real-time, this verfification step can be removed and people in need can directly check which reources are available.

## User Flow

After spending a lot of time deliberating, researching and perfecting our UI prototypes, and the final look on the app, we came up with a design which not only combated the problems our competitors face - like that of having a learning curve to operate the service, we made it easy to locate all resources and manage everything that needed to be looked at, through the home page itself. Our belief was to make a very intuitive platform, and one that would streamline the process of management greatly.

The dashboard system, where hospitals manage their own staff, equipment and supplies, and keep it in check, allows hospitals to share their resources and come together. The transfer of goods is verified using blockchain.

During this almost Third World War, all medical faculties would have to work together, pitch in, look beyond just profit to help out other surrounding hospitals to keep operating, and ensure that no patient is left unseen.

Let's work together to defeat the virus.
